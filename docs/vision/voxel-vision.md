# Voxel Product Vision

> **AI made building fast. We make sure what's built is right.**

---

## Mission Statement

### What problem are we solving?
The bottleneck in product development has shifted. AI coding tools (Cursor, Claude Code, Lovable) have made building 3x faster, but most features still fail in the market. Teams ship faster than ever, but they're shipping the wrong things.

**The real bottleneck is certainty, not velocity.**

### For whom?
- **Primary:** Product Managers, Product Designers at B2B SaaS companies (50-500 employees)
- **Secondary:** Engineering leaders, Sales leaders, CX leaders
- **Economic Buyer:** Head of R&D / CTO / Head of Product Design

### Why does it matter?
- Most features miss the mark at v1 (and usually v2)
- Discovery, design, and validation remain underserved by AI tooling
- Teams waste engineering cycles building features that don't solve real problems
- The cost of building the wrong thing is higher than ever (opportunity cost in a fast-moving market)

---

## Our Thesis

### Consensus (What everyone agrees on)
- AI is transforming how products get built
- Most features miss the mark and don't achieve measurable results
- Knowing what to build is still hard - validation reduces risk, but AI hasn't made it faster
- AI-assisted coding tools are making developers more productive by shifting their role from writing code to exercising judgment

### Non-consensus (Our bets)
1. **The main bottleneck is lack of certainty, not coding velocity**
2. **Scaling a product from 1→100 isn't just an optimization of what worked in the 0→1 vibe-coding phase**
3. **Discovery, design, and validation remain underserved by AI tooling**
4. **What's running in production matters more than the codebase or Figma**

---

## Product Principles

### What we believe
1. **Validate before you build** - The cheapest bug to fix is the feature you never built
2. **Start from 1, not 0** - Existing products need context-aware evolution, not generic generation
3. **Real prototypes > Static mockups** - Prototypes that look exactly like your product get real feedback
4. **Ship winners, not guesses** - Only build what's proven to work with users
5. **The running product is the source of truth** - Not Figma, not the codebase

### What we won't do
- Replace Figma for 0→1 design work
- Compete with coding tools (Cursor, Claude Code) for implementation
- Require access to codebases or infrastructure
- Build generic AI app builders

---

## Target Users

### Primary Persona: Product Manager at Growth-Stage SaaS
**Jobs to be done:**
- Validate feature ideas before committing engineering resources
- Get stakeholder alignment on solution direction
- Communicate product vision to customers and internal teams
- Reduce iteration cycles after launch

**Current pain:**
- Prototypes in Figma don't look like the real product
- Validation takes weeks (design → feedback → iterate → repeat)
- Feedback is scattered across Slack, Zoom, emails
- Engineering builds features that need 3+ iterations to get right

### Secondary Persona: Product Designer
**Jobs to be done:**
- Create high-fidelity prototypes quickly
- Test multiple design variants
- Get real user feedback on designs
- Hand off validated designs to engineering

### Secondary Persona: Sales/CX Leader
**Jobs to be done:**
- Show prospects/customers potential solutions
- Unblock deals waiting on "future features"
- Demonstrate product direction without engineering involvement

---

## Success Metrics

### North Star Metric
**Validation Cycle Time**: Time from idea → validated solution ready for development

**Target:** Reduce from 4-6 weeks → 1 week

### Supporting KPIs
| Metric | Current State | Target |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| Time to first prototype | 1-2 weeks | Hours |
| Iterations before "validated" | 5-8 | 2-3 |
| Features that hit KPIs at v1 | ~20% | 60%+ |
| Stakeholder alignment time | Days | Hours |
| Engineering rework cycles | 3+ iterations | 1 iteration |

### Business Metrics
- $1M ARR within 12 months
- <12 month CAC payback
- Expansion to $50K+ ACV enterprise within 24 months

## Competitive Positioning

### Market Landscape

| Competitor | Focus | Data Source | Our Differentiation |
|------------|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Magic Patterns** | AI design/prototyping from prompts | Component capture | We capture running product, not just components |
| **Alloy.app** | Prototyping using existing components | Single screen capture | Full product context + validation workflow |
| **Reforge Build** | Vibe coding for existing products | Single screen capture | Validation focus, not just building |
| **Make (Figma)** | Designer collaboration & handoff | Design files | Production reality vs. designer intent |
| **Builder.io** | Enterprise design-to-code | Design files + codebase | No code access required, validation-first |

### Why Voxel Wins

**vs. Code Tools (Cursor, Claude Code):**
- Captures running product, not codebase
- Safe for non-technical users - no code access, no risk
- Validates before development

**vs. Figma:**
- Captures production reality, not designer intent
- Always current - evolves with your product
- Understands flows, states, and behaviors

### Our Unfair Advantages
1. **Hybrid Architecture:** LLM for creative intent + ML for pattern recognition + Deterministic semantic layer for consistency
2. **Product context capture:** Few clicks to snapshot live app without code access
3. **Validation workflow:** Built-in feedback collection, heatmaps, analytics
4. **1→100 focus:** Not competing in crowded 0→1 space

## The Product

### Core Value Proposition
**Validate faster, iterate based on market feedback before it goes to production**

### Product Workflow

#### 1. Your Product Context
- Capture your live app with a few clicks (browser extension)
- No intrusive permissions or access to codebase or infra
- Extract components library automatically

#### 2. Build in Minutes, Not Weeks
- Prompt: "Add upgrade seat request flow for free members"
- Voxel builds using YOUR components
- Always matches your brand/UX
- Generate multiple variants (A, B, C, D)

#### 3. Validate with Real Users
- Share prototypes that look exactly like your product
- Heatmaps, analytics, user feedback
- Session recordings
- Multiplayer commenting
- Know what works BEFORE development

#### 4. Collaborate & Ship Winners
- Validate with users, align with engineering, ship with confidence
- Export front-end code with your actual components
- Everyone works with validated, production-ready prototypes
- Push to dev tools (Cursor, Claude Code) for implementation

## Use Cases Across Product Lifecycle

### Solution Design
Prompting Voxel with business context and customers' pain/market opportunity and create solution variants based on the existing product state and design system

### Solution Validation
Share with potential customers, existing ones, end-users and internal stakeholders (sales, CX, support) and gather feedback which will be used to iterate on the initial variations

### Product Releases
Enable customer-facing teams with product-like, interactive prototypes, and share them as educational assets to customers as part of release communication

### GTM Discovery
Support sales and CX executives to demonstrate potential solutions to strategic customers/prospects, unblocking deals at risk

---

## Strategic Bets & Risks

### Key Hypotheses We're Testing
1. **Product teams will adopt a new validation workflow** if it's 10x faster than current process
2. **Non-technical users (PMs, designers) can create production-quality prototypes** with the right context
3. **Validation data (heatmaps, feedback) will convince engineering to trust prototype-driven specs**
4. **Sales/CX teams will use prototypes** to unblock deals and demonstrate future features

### Biggest Risks
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Product capture quality/accuracy | Hybrid architecture (LLM + ML + deterministic layer) |
| Adoption friction (new workflow) | Start with design partners, iterate on onboarding |
| Competition from Figma/code tools adding validation | Move fast, build validation moat |
| Enterprise security concerns | No code access, browser-only capture |
